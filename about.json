    "bio": "I am currently in Boston studying full-stack software engineering at an intensive 12-week, project-based program run by General Assembly, including technologies such as JavaScript, Python, and React. I previously worked as a philosophy professor in the UK, teaching courses about ethics, well-being, and other topics, and writing research papers that were published in some of the leading journals in the field. My experience in philosophy helped me develop skills in critical and logical thinking that I'm looking to take advantage of as I launch a new career in tech."
